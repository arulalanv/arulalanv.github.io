<h2><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p></h2>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Movie recommendation framework is used to recommend movie to a user depends upon his taste. Such framework has part of suggestions what's more, is enlivened by the accomplishment of recommendation frameworks in various spaces, for example, books, TV program. Recommendation is most important break through in the television fiels. The most understood recommendation frameworks are principally in view of Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-based Filtering. Apart from CF many techniques are used  to construct recommender system CF first step to discover the gatherings of comparative users consequently from an arrangement of users. The similitudes between users are figured utilizing correlation. Albeit Collaborative Filtering (CF) is fruitful in numerous domains, be that as it may, it has inadequacies for example, sparsity and versatility. CF utilizes user ratings to find comparative users. In any case, it is exceptionally hard to discover such since not very many movies have ratings. The effectiveness of proposed methods demonstrated using movielens data sets. Bagher et al has proposed content Movie. Temporal User Preferences can also be used for recommendation. A content-based recommendation system can be used in many domains. TF-IDF and Information Gain (IG) are used for this purpose.</p>
<h2><p><strong>Proposed Work</strong></p></h2>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed work uses MovieLens 100K data set [13]. This data set consists of: 100,000 ratings,  ranges 0 to 5 from 943 users on 1682 movies.  Each user has rated at least 20 movies. Another data file consists of informations regarding the user’s like age, gender, occupation and zip. The proposed work consists of four main stages, they are preprocessing, pivot table creation, cosine similarity generation, and recommendation section. This proposed work is developed using python and apache pig. The dataflow of this proposed system is shown in figure below.</p>
